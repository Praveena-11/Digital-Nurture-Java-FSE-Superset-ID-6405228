Big O notation is used to describe the time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of input size n.
It helps analyze how an algorithm's performance scales as the dataset grows, especially in the worst-case scenario.

Common time complexities include:

O(1) – Constant time (e.g., accessing an array element).
O(n) – Linear time (e.g., linear search).
O(log n) – Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).

It allows developers to compare and choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.
For search operations, we consider three performance cases:

Best Case: The element is found immediately (e.g., first element in linear search).
Average Case: The element is found somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: The element is last or not present at all (maximum comparisons needed).

This analysis is essential for optimizing search functionality in an e-commerce platform, where fast performance improves user satisfaction and reduces server load.
