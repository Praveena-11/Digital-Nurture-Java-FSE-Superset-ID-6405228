 Time Complexity
The recursive solution has O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of years.

This is because each recursive call reduces the number of years by 1, resulting in n total recursive calls.

Optimization
To optimize more complex recursive problems:
Use memoization.Or convert the solution into an iterative approach, which avoids function call overhead and stack usage.
