Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller instance of a problem until a base condition is met.
It is especially useful in problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems, such as mathematical calculations, tree traversal, or forecasting patterns.
In financial forecasting, recursion can be used to model how a value (like investment) grows over time, based on a consistent growth rate.
